# Customized Object Detection
  - Iâ€™ve developed a customized Object Detection System using YOLOv8, capable of identifying and categorizing objects in images of people and check if they wear mask or not. 

# Instruction
## Aim
  - Develop a system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams.
## Description
  - Create an object detection model capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image or video. Utilize a pre-trained model such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, and customize it to detect specific objects of interest.
