# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Intern

## As an Oasis Infobyte Intern, I have created the following projects
  1. Used KNN, GNB, and Voting Classifier with Iris Dataset to predict the species based on the length and width of Sepal and Petal. The model has 96% of accuracy.
  2. I analyzed the unemployment in 2020 due to COVID-19 and predicted the unemployment rate in 2021 using Time Series Forecasting(Prophet)
