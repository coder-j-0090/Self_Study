# Memory Systems Projects

A collection of low-level system programming projects developed in C on a Linux environment, focusing on memory behavior, I/O operations, and hardware-software interfacing. 
These projects demonstrate practical understanding of memory control, buffering, file systems, and driver-level programmingâ€”skills that align with roles in memory engineering and embedded systems.

## ðŸ”§ Projects

### 1. [Linux Device Driver with Encryption]
A custom Linux character device driver that supports encrypted I/O operations through `read`, `write`, and `ioctl`. 
It includes user-space interaction via a test program. Demonstrates direct memory access control and kernel-user space communication.

### 2. [Buffered I/O and Block Operations]
Implements a buffered I/O system handling block-level file access, EOF detection, and memory management. 
Built to simulate how real-world I/O buffering works beneath standard file systems.

### 3. [Custom Shell with Pipes]
A minimal shell implementation that supports command parsing, piping, and redirection using `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`. 
Serves as the foundation for testing and scripting automation workflows.

### 4. [Custom File System]
A simplified C-based file system supporting directory structures, free space management, and persistent storage. 
Reinforces memory allocation, block access, and file metadata handling.

### 5. [Memory Buffering and Structs]
C program exploring in-memory buffering, binary data structuring, and hexadecimal representation for low-level data analysis and debugging.

### 6. [Linux Command Line Parser]
A simple command-line parser in C that handles file inputs, arguments, and basic validation. 
Useful for scripting environments and CLI-based tools.


## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- Linux systems programming (C, Makefile, system calls)
- Device driver development and testing
- File system logic and memory structure simulation
- Shell scripting fundamentals
- Block-level I/O and buffer management
- Debugging workflows and low-level error handling


## ðŸ“‚ Environment
- Language: C
- Platform: Ubuntu Linux (GCC, Make)
- Tools: GDB, `make`, custom I/O test scripts


## ðŸ“Œ Note
These projects were developed as part of advanced undergraduate coursework in system programming, 
and restructured to reflect real-world relevance in memory and validation engineering roles.
