# Projects

## Internship Project

### AI: CodeClause Internship Projects
  1. Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI with MiniMax Algorithm
  2. Object Detection System(Both pics and vids, use CV to find object with basic(laptop) camera

### Data Science: Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects
  1. Classify the Iris dataset and find out what the flower is based on sepal and petal length using KNN, GNB, and Voting Classifier, which have 96% accuracy
  2. Predict Unemployment rates in India with Prophet(Time-Series Forecasting)
  3. Figure out which factors of the car affect car price and predict the sales price of the car with XGB Regressor


## Personal Project

### Data Science Projects(Projects from Oasis Inforbyte)
When I got a data science internship from Oasis Infobyte, they assigned me 5 tasks, and I had to finish only 3. However, I decided to do 2 leftover projects as well.
  
  1. Email Spam Detection with Naive Bayes Machine Learning Models: Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli.  and among all those models, the Bernoulli model got the highest accuracy with 97.93%. Gaussian got 88.78%, Multinomial got 97.13%, and Bernoulli got 97.93% of accuracy. Therefore, the Bernoulli ML model fits the best for the goal.
  2. Sales Prediction using Python

### CV(Computer Vision)
  1. Detect objects from pictures, videos, and webcam with YOLOV8.
