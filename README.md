# Self-Study Repository

Welcome to my self-study repository! Here, I document my learning journey, track my progress, and share my knowledge on various topics. 
This repository serves as a way for me to organize my learning materials and possibly show recruiters who are interested in the same subjects.

## Project

I have uploaded a few AI projects and multiple data science projects. I'm going to upload more data science projects, which I have a huge interest and passion!

### Progress

I'll update my progress on each topic as I make advancements. You can check the progress of my studies by visiting individual topic folders.

### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to my self-study journey, you can:

- Provide suggestions or corrections.
- Share additional resources related to the topics I'm studying.
- Collaborate on projects or articles.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests with your contributions.
